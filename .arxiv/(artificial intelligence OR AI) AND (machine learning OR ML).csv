Practical Statistical Considerations for the Clinical Validation of AI/ML-enabled Medical Diagnostic Devices,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine-Learning (ML) models have been
increasingly used in medical products, such as medical device software. General
considerations on the statistical aspects for the evaluation of AI/ML-enabled
medical diagnostic devices are discussed in this paper. We also provide
relevant academic references and note good practices in addressing various
statistical challenges in the clinical validation of AI/ML-enabled medical
devices in the context of their intended use.",2023-03-02,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05399v1,0.6221065579842383
Forecasting AI Progress: Evidence from a Survey of Machine Learning Researchers,"Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are shaping modern life, from
transportation, health care, science, finance, to national defense. Forecasts
of AI development could help improve policy- and decision-making. We report the
results from a large survey of AI and machine learning (ML) researchers on
their beliefs about progress in AI. The survey, fielded in late 2019, elicited
forecasts for near-term AI development milestones and high- or human-level
machine intelligence, defined as when machines are able to accomplish every or
almost every task humans are able to do currently. As part of this study, we
re-contacted respondents from a highly-cited study by Grace et al. (2018), in
which AI/ML researchers gave forecasts about high-level machine intelligence
and near-term milestones in AI development. Results from our 2019 survey show
that, in aggregate, AI/ML researchers surveyed placed a 50% likelihood of
human-level machine intelligence being achieved by 2060. The results show
researchers newly contacted in 2019 expressed similar beliefs about the
progress of advanced AI as respondents in the Grace et al. (2018) survey. For
the recontacted participants from the Grace et al. (2018) study, the aggregate
forecast for a 50% likelihood of high-level machine intelligence shifted from
2062 to 2076, although this change is not statistically significant, likely due
to the small size of our panel sample. Forecasts of several near-term AI
milestones have reduced in time, suggesting more optimism about AI progress.
Finally, AI/ML researchers also exhibited significant optimism about how
human-level machine intelligence will impact society.",2022-06-08,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04132v1,0.60713856474741
"A Large-Scale, Automated Study of Language Surrounding Artificial Intelligence","This work presents a large-scale analysis of artificial intelligence (AI) and
machine learning (ML) references within news articles and scientific
publications between 2011 and 2019. We implement word association measurements
that automatically identify shifts in language co-occurring with AI/ML and
quantify the strength of these word associations. Our results highlight the
evolution of perceptions and definitions around AI/ML and detect emerging
application areas, models, and systems (e.g., blockchain and cybersecurity).
Recent small-scale, manual studies have explored AI/ML discourse within the
general public, the policymaker community, and researcher community, but are
limited in their scalability and longevity. Our methods provide new views into
public perceptions and subject-area expert discussions of AI/ML and greatly
exceed the explanative power of prior work.",2021-02-24,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12516v1,0.6069875606716411
Confident AI,"In this paper, we propose ""Confident AI"" as a means to designing Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) systems with both algorithm and
user confidence in model predictions and reported results. The 4 basic tenets
of Confident AI are Repeatability, Believability, Sufficiency, and
Adaptability. Each of the tenets is used to explore fundamental issues in
current AI/ML systems and together provide an overall approach to Confident AI.",2022-02-12,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.05957v1,0.5889562298853853
Advancing the Research and Development of Assured Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Capabilities,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have become
increasingly vital in the development of novel defense and intelligence
capabilities across all domains of warfare. An adversarial AI (A2I) and
adversarial ML (AML) attack seeks to deceive and manipulate AI/ML models. It is
imperative that AI/ML models can defend against these attacks. A2I/AML defenses
will help provide the necessary assurance of these advanced capabilities that
use AI/ML models. The A2I Working Group (A2IWG) seeks to advance the research
and development of assured AI/ML capabilities via new A2I/AML defenses by
fostering a collaborative environment across the U.S. Department of Defense and
U.S. Intelligence Community. The A2IWG aims to identify specific challenges
that it can help solve or address more directly, with initial focus on three
topics: AI Trusted Robustness, AI System Security, and AI/ML Architecture
Vulnerabilities.",2020-09-24,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.13250v1,0.5856910676443232
Principles for Evaluation of AI/ML Model Performance and Robustness,"The Department of Defense (DoD) has significantly increased its investment in
the design, evaluation, and deployment of Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning (AI/ML) capabilities to address national security needs. While there
are numerous AI/ML successes in the academic and commercial sectors, many of
these systems have also been shown to be brittle and nonrobust. In a complex
and ever-changing national security environment, it is vital that the DoD
establish a sound and methodical process to evaluate the performance and
robustness of AI/ML models before these new capabilities are deployed to the
field. This paper reviews the AI/ML development process, highlights common best
practices for AI/ML model evaluation, and makes recommendations to DoD
evaluators to ensure the deployment of robust AI/ML capabilities for national
security needs.",2021-07-06,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.02868v1,0.5711083278424364
Measuring AI Systems Beyond Accuracy,"Current test and evaluation (T&E) methods for assessing machine learning (ML)
system performance often rely on incomplete metrics. Testing is additionally
often siloed from the other phases of the ML system lifecycle. Research
investigating cross-domain approaches to ML T&E is needed to drive the state of
the art forward and to build an Artificial Intelligence (AI) engineering
discipline. This paper advocates for a robust, integrated approach to testing
by outlining six key questions for guiding a holistic T&E strategy.",2022-04-07,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.04211v1,0.5208546897960301
CTI4AI: Threat Intelligence Generation and Sharing after Red Teaming AI Models,"As the practicality of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
based techniques grow, there is an ever increasing threat of adversarial
attacks. There is a need to red team this ecosystem to identify system
vulnerabilities, potential threats, characterize properties that will enhance
system robustness, and encourage the creation of effective defenses. A
secondary need is to share this AI security threat intelligence between
different stakeholders like, model developers, users, and AI/ML security
professionals. In this paper, we create and describe a prototype system CTI4AI,
to overcome the need to methodically identify and share AI/ML specific
vulnerabilities and threat intelligence.",2022-08-16,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.07476v1,0.5125292929956171
AI/ML for Beam Management in 5G-Advanced,"In beamformed wireless cellular systems such as 5G New Radio (NR) networks,
beam management (BM) is a crucial operation. In the second phase of 5G NR
standardization, known as 5G-Advanced, which is being vigorously promoted, the
key component is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) based on machine
learning (ML) techniques. AI/ML for BM is selected as a representative use
case. This article provides an overview of the AI/ML for BM in 5G-Advanced. The
legacy non-AI and prime AI-enabled BM frameworks are first introduced and
compared. Then, the main scope of AI/ML for BM is presented, including
improving accuracy, reducing overhead and latency. Finally, the key challenges
and open issues in the standardization of AI/ML for BM are discussed,
especially the design of new protocols for AI-enabled BM. This article provides
a guideline for the study of AI/ML-based BM standardization.",2023-09-19,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10575v1,0.49737939967585165
Proceedings of the Robust Artificial Intelligence System Assurance (RAISA) Workshop 2022,"The Robust Artificial Intelligence System Assurance (RAISA) workshop will
focus on research, development and application of robust artificial
intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems. Rather than studying
robustness with respect to particular ML algorithms, our approach will be to
explore robustness assurance at the system architecture level, during both
development and deployment, and within the human-machine teaming context. While
the research community is converging on robust solutions for individual AI
models in specific scenarios, the problem of evaluating and assuring the
robustness of an AI system across its entire life cycle is much more complex.
Moreover, the operational context in which AI systems are deployed necessitates
consideration of robustness and its relation to principles of fairness,
privacy, and explainability.",2022-02-10,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.04787v1,0.48242438029502943
